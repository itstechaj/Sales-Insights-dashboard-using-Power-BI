# Sales-Insights-dashboard-using-Power-BI
*A picture is worth a thousand words.*

The time has gone when companies have to manually go over lots of excel data sheets to analyse their sales reports in today's time we can create dashboards from the data
which is more user friendly and convenient so that also a person with non technical background can get their work done easily.

**So I have created this awesome Sales Insights Dashboard for a dummy company using mysql and Power BI.**
